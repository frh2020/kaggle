# kaggle_titanic

N-models jupyter notebook, kaggle-titanic-ens-n-models.ipynb, demostrates how to train 10 different machine learning models from scikit-learn to predict for titanic data.

Ensemble method, soft voting and stacking are also impletmented to compare to those models 

These models are: random forest, svm, logistic regression, gaussian naive bayesion, decision tree, k-nearest neighbour, adaboost, xgboost, catboost, deep neural network.
