## House Price: Advanced Regression Techniqueswith Pycaret

### First run:

- Data exploration: remove features with more than 10 data point in either train or test dataset.

- Data imputation, transformation, and processing in Pycaret

- Train, tune, and compare 5 models: Random Forest, SVM, XGboost, Light GBM, Catboost.

- Blend and stack models

- Predict on hold-out and test data

### Next step:

- Feature engineering: missing data imputation, feature selection.

- Testing Pycaret setup parameter

- Model hyperparameter testing
