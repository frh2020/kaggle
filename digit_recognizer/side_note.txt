Scalars - Visualize scalar values, such as classification accuracy.

Graph - Visualize the computational graph of your model, such as the neural network model.

Distributions - Visualize how data changes over time, such as the weights of a neural network.

Histograms - A fancier view of the distribution that shows distributions in a 3-dimensional perspective

Projector - Can be used to visualize word embeddings (that is, word embeddings are numerical representations of words that capture their semantic relationships)

Image - Visualizing image data

Audio - Visualizing audio data

Text - Visualizing text (string) data
